### Hey👋, I'm Ibrahim A. Shukoor 💻

I’m a Senior AI Engineer @ APRIL by Azista Industries, where I solve space‑tech problems using satellite imagery and space‑related data. I design ML/DL models and turn ideas into working prototypes and MVPs, mostly with AI at the core.

By day, I build and improve the company’s core AI‑driven products; by night, I work on my own projects and experiment with new ideas in machine learning and computer vision.

    🌱 currently geeking out on agentic AI and frontend frameworks
